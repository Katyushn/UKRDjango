# UKRDjango
Django framework and builder similar to CMS Joomla or Wordpress
In this project, I combined the capabilities of the Django framework and a classic CMS system like Joomla or WordPress.
What happened:
- the ability to run a website locally in one click
- the ability to manage the site through the administrator system
- the ability to add additional functionality as on a regular Django project
